# Image_To_Text_Converter
This a Image to text converter tool using COHERE API and Hugging Face API.


This tool takes an image as an input and generates a scenario which is nothing but a small description of the image that is generated. Further more the tool generates a random story based on the small description that is generated early than this. The story generated is related to the generated scenario which is very random.

To use the project from GitHub, anyone can follow these steps:

 #### Step 1: Clone the Repository
To clone the project from GitHub to a local machine, use the following command:

1. **Copy the repository URL**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository page.
   - Click the green "Code" button.
   - Copy the URL (HTTPS or SSH).

2. **Open a terminal on your machine and run**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
   ```
   Replace `YourUsername/YourRepoName` with the actual username and repository name.

3. **Navigate to the cloned repository**:
   ```bash
   cd YourRepoName
   ```

 ### Step 2: Set Up the Project Locally
Once the code is cloned, follow these steps to run it on a local machine.

 #### Option 1: Using Python's Built-In Environment Management
1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   The repository should contain a `requirements.txt` file, which lists all the dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Option 2: Using `pipenv` (Alternative)
If you're using `pipenv`, you can install dependencies and create a virtual environment with:
```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

### Step 3: Add API Keys to `.env` File
Make sure to provide the necessary API keys (Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.):

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
2. Add the following content to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Application
You can now run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and the app will open in the default web browser.

### Step 5: Access the Application in a Browser
Once Streamlit starts running, it will provide a local URL, usually something like:
```
http://localhost:8501
```
Open that link in a web browser to use the application.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd YourRepoName`
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Add API keys** to the `.env` file.
6. **Run the Streamlit app**: `streamlit run app.py`

Once these steps are completed, the application should be running and available for use.
